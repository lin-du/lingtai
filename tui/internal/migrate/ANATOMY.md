# migrate (TUI)

> **Maintenance:** see the `lingtai-tui-anatomy` skill at `tui/internal/preset/skills/lingtai-tui-anatomy/SKILL.md`. Coding agents update this file in same-commit as code changes. **Cross-binary contract:** when bumping `CurrentVersion`, also bump `portal/internal/migrate/migrate.go`.

## What this is

Versioned, append-only, forward-only migration system for per-project `.lingtai/` state. The TUI and portal share the `meta.json` version space; both registries must bump in lockstep. Each `m<NNN>_<name>.go` file registers one migration; `Run()` runs pending migrations sequentially, then stamps `CurrentVersion` into `meta.json`.

## Components

| Symbol | Citation | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `CurrentVersion` | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:12` | latest version compiled into this binary (currently 36) |
| `Migration` struct | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:20` | `{Version int, Name string, Fn func(string) error}` |
| `migrations` slice | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:27` | ordered list of all m001..m036, append-only |
| `Run(lingtaiDir)` | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:68` | reads `meta.json` → runs pending migrations → persists atomically |
| `StampCurrent(lingtaiDir)` | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:116` | stamps `CurrentVersion` without running migrations (fresh projects) |
| `metaFile` struct | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:14` | `{Version int, AddonCommentCleanupNotified bool}` |
| `persistMeta` | `tui/internal/migrate/migrate.go:141` | atomic temp+rename write of `meta.json` |
| m001 | `tui/internal/migrate/m001_topology.go:9` | move `topology.jsonl` from `.tui-asset/` to `.portal/` |
| m015 | `tui/internal/migrate/m015_timemachine_gitignore.go` | add `.gitignore` to timemachine dir |
| m026 | `tui/internal/migrate/m026_preset_path_form.go` | rewrite preset paths to `~/...` form |
| m029 | `tui/internal/migrate/m029_preset_allowed_list.go:32` | legacy `path` → declarative `allowed` list |
| m030 | `tui/internal/migrate/m030_preset_dir_split.go` | split flat `presets/` → `templates/` + `saved/` |
| m033 | `tui/internal/migrate/m033_strip_codex_api_key_env.go:21` | strip bogus `api_key_env` from saved codex presets |
| m034 | `tui/internal/migrate/m034_library_skills_caps.go:23` | rename capability keys `codex`→`library` and `library`→`skills` |
| m035 | `tui/internal/migrate/m035_remove_brief.go:13` | strip secretary-era brief plumbing: delete `system/brief.md`, drop `brief`/`brief_file` keys from each agent `init.json`, drop `brief` from `human/settings.json` |
| m036 | `tui/internal/migrate/m036_sqlite_log_backfill.go:34` | optional command-line prompt/progress to backfill stopped agents' historical `events.jsonl` into derived `logs/log.sqlite`; safe to skip |
| m037 | `tui/internal/migrate/m037_preset_skills_paths.go` | patch saved preset skill path overrides for the shared-library split |
| m038 | `tui/internal/migrate/m038_agent_init_skills_paths.go` | restore missing `skills.paths` in per-agent `init.json` (PR #340) |
| m039 | `tui/internal/migrate/m039_agent_init_context_preset_repair.go` | combined catch-up: (1) calls m038 idempotently to cover projects stamped at v38 by the PR #357 binary, (2) copies legacy root `context_limit` into `llm.context_limit`, (3) rewrites stale codex preset refs (PR #357 + collision resolution) |

**Versions 38 and 39 — collision history.** PR #340 and PR #357 independently claimed migration version 38. The collision was discovered when a project migrated by one branch binary got `data version 38 is newer than this binary supports (37)` after returning to origin/main. Resolution in `fix/migration-version-collision-20260620`: PR #340's repair (skills-paths) takes v38; PR #357's repair (context/preset) takes v39 as a combined catch-up that also calls m038 idempotently, so any project previously stamped at v38 by either old binary still receives both repairs.

Each migration file exports one `func migrateXxx(lingtaiDir string) error`. m002 is a no-op `func(_ string) error { return nil }` — it preserves the version slot.

## Connections

- **Called by** `tui/main.go` — Bootstrap runs `Run(lingtaiDir)` on startup; `InitProject` calls `StampCurrent` for fresh projects.
- **Reads/writes** `<project>/.lingtai/meta.json` — version stamp shared with portal.
- **Migrations touch** `init.json`, `presets/saved/`, `.portal/`, `.tui-asset/`, and agent subdirectories. m036 may also create/replace derived per-agent `logs/log.sqlite` when the user explicitly confirms the backfill prompt.
- **Cross-binary contract with portal** — see `portal/internal/migrate/ANATOMY.md`. Each `CurrentVersion` bump must be mirrored. Migrations touching shared state (e.g. m029, m030) live in both packages. TUI-only migrations get a no-op stub in the portal registry.

## Composition

- **Parent:** `tui/internal/` (no own anatomy)
- **Subfolders:** none — flat package, one file per migration
- **Siblings:** `tui/internal/preset/ANATOMY.md` — m029/m030 reference preset directory layout; `tui/internal/globalmigrate/` — per-machine analogue under `~/.lingtai-tui/`; `tui/internal/processscan/` — m036 reuses ps-based running-agent detection before attempting offline SQLite rebuilds

## State

- **`<project>/.lingtai/meta.json`** — `{"version": <N>, "addon_comment_cleanup_notified": <bool>}`. Written atomically (temp+rename) on every migration run.
- **Per-agent `init.json`** — mutated by several migrations (m017 rename caps, m024 add active preset, m026 path form, m027 strip media, m028 addons→MCP, m029 allowed list, m034 library/skills capability keys, m038 skills.paths, m039 context/preset repair).

## Notes

- **Append-only, forward-only.** Never delete or reorder `migrations` entries. Never implement reverse migrations. A version bump is permanent — downstream binaries refuse to open projects stamped with a newer version.
- **Cross-binary contract.** This is the single most important rule in the package. When bumping `CurrentVersion`, you MUST also bump `portal/internal/migrate/migrate.go`. Shared migrations need identical logic in both packages. TUI-only migrations get a no-op stub in the portal. Otherwise the portal refuses to open any project the TUI has touched.
- **No-op stubs preserve slots.** m002 is `func(_ string) error { return nil }` — its slot in the register must be held so later migration version numbers don't shift.
- **Fresh-project shortcut.** `StampCurrent` writes `CurrentVersion` without running migrations — a freshly-generated project conforms to the current schema by construction. Running historical migrations against it would corrupt valid data (e.g. m016 renames `library→codex`, but a fresh project never had the old key).
- **Version-check error.** `Run` returns `"data version N is newer than this binary supports (M); upgrade lingtai-tui"` when meta.json version exceeds `CurrentVersion`.
- **Idempotent.** Migrations are designed to be re-runnable — they check preconditions and skip if already applied (e.g. m029 checks for existing `allowed` list).
- **Optional sidecar backfill.** m036 is a TUI-only, user-confirmed command-line migration for the kernel SQLite log sidecar. It warns that large histories may take time, shows progress when confirmed, and emphasizes that skipping does not affect normal use because JSONL remains the source of truth.
- **Collision-recovery pattern.** When two branches claim the same version number and one has already migrated a real project, use a combined catch-up entry at the next free version: call the earlier branch's function idempotently first, then the later branch's logic. This ensures any project stamped at the collision version by either old binary still receives both repairs on next launch. See m039 for the canonical example.
