# Swiss Knife — Utility Toolkit

A collection of small, useful skills. Each sub-skill lives in its own folder under `swiss-knife/` and is fully self-contained — scripts, assets, and a SKILL.md with complete instructions.

## Sub-Skills

| Sub-Skill | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| [token-usage](token-usage/) | Network-wide token cost calculator using litellm + OpenRouter pricing | Human asks about costs, budget, token usage, or spending |
| [claude-code](claude-code/) | Delegate code implementation, patch writing, docs, and refactoring to Claude Code CLI | Human asks to write code, generate patches, refactor, or delegate implementation work |

## How to Use

1. **Identify the sub-skill** — match the human's request to the one-liner in the table above.
2. **Read the sub-skill's SKILL.md** — `swiss-knife/<name>/SKILL.md` has full instructions, script paths, and examples.
3. **Run the script** — each sub-skill bundles its own executable scripts. Follow the sub-skill's README for the exact command.

## Adding New Sub-Skills

To add a new utility to the swiss-knife:

1. Create a folder: `swiss-knife/<name>/`
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `version`) and full usage instructions
3. Add any scripts/assets in a `scripts/` subfolder
4. Update the table above with a one-liner
5. Refresh the library: `library(action='refresh')` or `system(action='refresh')`

## Design Philosophy

Each sub-skill follows these principles:
- **Self-contained** — all code and assets live in the sub-skill folder
- **Single-purpose** — one sub-skill does one thing well
- **Documented** — SKILL.md has enough context to use without reading source code
- **Small** — if it's bigger than ~200 lines of code, it probably deserves its own top-level skill
