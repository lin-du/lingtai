# Claude Code CLI — Code Delegation

Delegate code work to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Anthropic's coding agent — running non-interactively from bash.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed: `which claude` → `/Users/huangzesen/.local/bin/claude`
- Uses the human's **Claude Max subscription** — no additional API costs
- Rate limit tier: `default_claude_max_20x` (effectively unlimited for typical use)

## Quick Usage

```bash
claude -p "your prompt here" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This runs Claude Code in non-interactive mode (`-p` = print and exit), skipping permission checks for automation.

## CLI vs Daemon — Which to Use

LingTai exposes Claude Code in two forms. They are **not interchangeable** — pick the one whose shape matches the work.

### CLI (`claude -p ...` via bash)

A single synchronous subprocess. You wait for it to finish, you get one transcript, the conversation ends when the bash call returns.

**Use the CLI when:**
- The task is **one-off** and you want the result inline — a typo fix, a single-file refactor, generating a snippet
- You want the output **threaded back into your current reasoning** (you'll read the diff and decide next steps yourself)
- The task is **quick** (under a few minutes) and budget-bounded
- You only need **one** of these running at a time

**Examples:**
```bash
# Fix a typo
claude -p "fix the typo in line 42 of README.md" --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Generate a small patch you'll review immediately
claude -p "add a --verbose flag to scripts/build.sh" --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Quick documentation pass on one file
claude -p "add docstrings to utils/parser.py" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Daemon (LingTai `daemon` capability with `backend="claude-code"`)

A persistent agent spawned by the LingTai kernel. Runs in its **own worktree**, with its **own context window**, on its **own branch**. You dispatch it, it works asynchronously, you come back and review the diff.

**Use the daemon when:**
- You need to run **multiple tasks in parallel** — three disjoint refactors at once, batch validation across N files
- The task is **complex or multi-step** — designing then implementing, exploring then refactoring — and you want a fresh context window dedicated to it (not competing with your conversation history)
- You need **context isolation** — the daemon shouldn't see (and shouldn't pollute) your current session's context
- The work runs **long enough** that a synchronous bash call would be awkward — large refactors, multi-file feature implementations, PR composition
- You're acting as an **orchestrator** — planning and reviewing, not hand-coding (see the LingTai contributing guide's orchestrator-and-daemons discipline)

**Examples of daemon-shaped work:**
- "Implement the caching layer in `feat/cache` branch, with tests, and open a PR" — long, multi-step, deserves its own worktree
- Three parallel skill rewrites that don't share files — dispatch three daemons, review three diffs
- An exploratory refactor where you don't want intermediate steps cluttering your conversation
- A "fire-and-check-back-later" task

### Quick decision rule

| Signal | Pick |
|--------|------|
| "I want the answer in this conversation, now" | **CLI** |
| "I want to do three of these at once" | **Daemon** (one per task) |
| "I'll review a diff afterward, not the transcript" | **Daemon** |
| "The output is a small string/snippet I'll paste somewhere" | **CLI** |
| "This will take 15+ minutes and produce a branch" | **Daemon** |
| "I'm the orchestrator; the daemon is the worker" | **Daemon** |

When in doubt for non-trivial work: daemon. The orchestrator/daemon split is the project's default discipline — see `utilities/lingtai-dev-guide/reference/contributing.md` for the full convention.

## Key Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-p` / `--print` | Non-interactive mode — run, print result, exit |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skip permission prompts (required for automation) |
| `--effort max` | Maximum reasoning effort for complex tasks |
| `--model opus` | Use Opus model for highest quality |
| `--model sonnet` | Use Sonnet model for speed (default) |
| `--max-budget-usd N` | Spending limit per call |
| `--allowedTools "Bash Edit Read Write"` | Restrict which tools Claude can use |
| `--system-prompt "..."` | Custom system prompt |
| `--add-dir /path/to/dir` | Grant access to additional directories |
| `-d /path/to/repo` | Set working directory |

## Recommended Patterns

### Simple task (default quality)
```bash
claude -p "fix the typo in README.md" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Complex implementation (max quality)
```bash
claude -p "implement the caching layer as described in DESIGN.md" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --effort max \
  --model opus
```

### With budget control
```bash
claude -p "refactor the auth module" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --effort max \
  --model opus \
  --max-budget-usd 5.0
```

### Working in a specific repo
```bash
claude -p "add unit tests for the parser module" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  -d /path/to/repo
```

### Restricted tools (safer)
```bash
claude -p "generate a patch for issue #42" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --allowedTools "Bash Edit Read Write"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Increase bash timeout**: Set `timeout=900` (15 minutes) on the bash tool call for complex tasks. Claude Code has no built-in timeout — the bash tool's timeout controls it.

2. **Use `--effort max` for complex work**: This tells Claude to think harder. Worth it for architecture, refactoring, and multi-file changes.

3. **Use `--model opus` for quality**: Opus produces better code for complex logic. Use Sonnet (default) for simple tasks.

4. **Split large tasks**: Multiple smaller `claude -p` calls chained together beat one monolithic prompt. Each call has its own context window.

5. **Write clear prompts**: Claude Code reads the repo context itself. Give it the goal, constraints, and acceptance criteria — don't dump the entire codebase into the prompt.

6. **Set budget for unknown tasks**: Use `--max-budget-usd` to prevent runaway spending on ambiguous tasks.

## Workflow for Patch/PR Creation

1. **Design**: Write a clear spec (what to change, why, constraints)
2. **Delegate**: Run `claude -p "implement: <spec>" --dangerously-skip-permissions --effort max`
3. **Review**: Check the output, run tests
4. **Push**: Create branch, commit, push as PR

## What to Delegate

- **Code implementation**: New features, bug fixes, refactoring
- **Patch generation**: Multi-file changes, API migrations
- **Documentation**: READMEs, docstrings, API docs
- **Test writing**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Code review**: Ask Claude to review a PR or diff

## What NOT to Delegate

- **Simple one-line edits**: Use the `edit` tool directly
- **File reading/searching**: Use `read`/`grep`/`glob` directly
- **Shell commands**: Use `bash` directly for non-code tasks
- **Tasks requiring your full context**: Claude Code doesn't share your conversation history

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Timeout after 30s | Increase `timeout=900` on bash call |
| Claude Code not found | Check `which claude` → `/Users/huangzesen/.local/bin/claude` |
| Permission errors | Always include `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| Output truncated | Check if Claude hit the budget limit |
| Rate limited | Wait and retry; Max tier has generous limits |
