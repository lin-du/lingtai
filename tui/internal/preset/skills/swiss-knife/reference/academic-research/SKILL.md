  Nested swiss-knife reference for academic literature work — find papers, fetch
  full-text PDFs, trace citations, write LaTeX manuscripts.
  **First action for any "get me this paper" request:**
  `python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py <DOI|arXiv-ID|PMID>` — walks
  arXiv → Unpaywall → Europe PMC → CORE → in-house publisher-page extraction (Nature/APS/AIP/IOP/Cambridge)
  → authorized institutional publisher → LibGen and saves the paper, metadata, and a resumable
  manifest under `papers/{slug}/`.
  Read the body when you need to escape the script: custom query shapes, citation networks,
  scholar analysis, LaTeX writing, or a tier-specific API call. Indexes 12 deep-dive API
  references and 6 pipeline workflows under `reference/`.
version: 3.0.0
allowed-tools: Bash(python3 *) Bash(curl *) Bash(pip *) Bash(pip3 *)
tags: [academic, research, arxiv, crossref, openalex, semantic-scholar, core, pubmed, unpaywall, doi, pdf, citation, pipeline, europe-pmc, nasa-ads, inspire-hep, nested-skill]

# Academic Research

> **Nested swiss-knife reference.** A modular skill: try the bundled script
> first, then load specific reference files only when you need to escape it.

## Try this first

For 80% of "get me this paper" requests, the bundled script is the right answer.
It walks the open-access ladder, falls back automatically, and writes a manifest
the next session can resume from.

```bash
# Fetch by any identifier
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py 10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.015001
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py arXiv:2301.00001
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py PMID:12345678

# Batch (one identifier per line in the file)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py --batch dois.txt --out papers/

# Resolve metadata only (no PDF download)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py 10.1038/nature12373 --dry-run

# Skip LibGen (e.g. legal-sensitive environment)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_paper.py <id> --no-libgen
```

**Output layout** (idempotent — re-runs skip entries with `status: ok`):

```
papers/{first-author-year-firstword}/
├── paper.pdf  |  paper.md      # full-text artifact
├── metadata.json                # CrossRef-normalized
└── manifest.json                # {status, tier, source, ts, doi}
```

**Tier ladder** (script stops at first hit):

| Tier | Source | Best for |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | arXiv direct | Preprints (physics, CS, math, q-bio, econ) |
| 2 | Unpaywall | Publisher-blessed gold/green OA |
| 3 | Europe PMC | Biomedical full-text + PMC mirror |
| 4 | CORE | Institutional repositories (needs `$CORE_API_KEY`) |
| 5 | Publisher-page extract | Nature/APS/AIP/IOP/Cambridge → in-house extractor (stdlib + `requests`, no third-party deps). Fetches the **already-accessible** official article / DOI landing page and parses `citation_*` metadata + the article body into structured Markdown. **No paywall/CAPTCHA bypass, no cookies/credentials** — official pages only. A login/paywall page is a clean miss; the ladder then falls through. Opt out with `--no-publisher-extract`. |
| 5b | Authorized publisher | **Licensed/institutional access only** — official DOI landing page → same-host publisher PDF → `%PDF-` validation, full provenance. Recovers paywalled-but-subscribed papers without shadow libraries. Never bypasses paywalls or handles credentials. Opt out with `--no-institutional`. See [authorized-publisher-access.md](reference/authorized-publisher-access.md). |
| 6 | LibGen | Last resort; opt out with `--no-libgen` |

**Set `$LINGTAI_RESEARCH_EMAIL` to a real address** before first use — Unpaywall
rejects placeholder emails with HTTP 422. The default falls back to
`lingtai-agent@example.org` with a warning.

Read on only if: the script fails on your paper, you need a custom query shape,
or you're composing a multi-step workflow (search → fetch → cite → write).

## Before drafting citation-bearing academic writing

> **Verify sources before you write prose.** If you are about to draft a paper,
> related-work section, literature review, References list, or any author–year /
> citation-bearing manuscript, pass the **evidence-verification gate first**:
> [reference/evidence-verification-gate.md](reference/evidence-verification-gate.md).
> No verified evidence → no confident prose. Peer-reviewed and preprint sources
> must not share the same evidence layer; search results are leads, not citations.
> If the user asks to "go fast," reduce *scope*, not *verification*. Produce a
> verified literature matrix **before** any submission-like draft.

## Escape hatch — quick paths

```
I'm about to write a paper / references / related-work section → reference/evidence-verification-gate.md (verify FIRST)
The user wants a "fast" / "readable" paper draft → reference/evidence-verification-gate.md (reduce scope, not verification)
I have a DOI                → reference/api-doi-resolver.md → api-crossref.md
I have an arXiv ID          → reference/api-arxiv.md (direct PDF link)
I have a PMID               → reference/api-europe-pmc.md
I have a bibcode            → reference/api-nasa-ads.md (requires free key)
I only have keywords        → reference/decision-tree.md → pick API by discipline
I need a citation network   → reference/api-semantic-scholar.md or api-openalex.md
I need to override the PDF ladder → reference/pipeline-obtain-pdf.md
Tier-5 publisher-extract failed and I want to retry it manually → reference/publisher-page-extraction.md
All OA chains failed        → reference/libgen-fallback.md (last resort)
I need astrophysics         → reference/api-nasa-ads.md
I need high-energy physics  → reference/api-inspire-hep.md
I need biomedical           → reference/api-europe-pmc.md or api-pubmed.md
I need to write/compile a paper → reference/pipeline-latex-writing.md
My empirical draft keeps getting reframed / reviewers "agree" → reference/anti-pattern-text-consistency-vs-data-correspondence.md
I hit an API error          → reference/error-handling.md
```

### Standalone references

- [evidence-verification-gate.md](reference/evidence-verification-gate.md) — **verify-before-drafting gate** for citation-bearing academic writing: detection triggers, the verified-literature-matrix schema, A/B/C evidence tiers, "go fast = reduce scope not verification," matrix-before-draft artifact convention, pre-draft lint
- [publisher-page-extraction.md](reference/publisher-page-extraction.md) — Tier-5 manual escape hatch (Nature/APS/AIP/IOP/Cambridge → structured Markdown)
- [libgen-fallback.md](reference/libgen-fallback.md) — Last-resort PDF source with legal/safety notes
- [error-handling.md](reference/error-handling.md) — 429 backoff, 403 publisher blocks, timeout patterns
- [anti-pattern-text-consistency-vs-data-correspondence.md](reference/anti-pattern-text-consistency-vs-data-correspondence.md) — empirical-writing failure mode: prose drifts from the data while reviewer rounds make it more polished. Trigger pattern, re-anchoring steps, detection checklist.

## Relationship to web-browsing

- **web-browsing** is the routing layer ("which tier to use for this URL?")
- **academic-research** is the deep-dive layer ("how do I write OpenAlex filter parameters? what email does Unpaywall want?")
- The two are complementary. If you're just scraping one publisher page and don't need the OA ladder, web-browsing's `extract_page.py` is lighter.

## Known caveats

- **Unpaywall's `email` parameter is required and must be real** — placeholder addresses get HTTP 422. Set `$LINGTAI_RESEARCH_EMAIL` once.
- **CORE without an API key is harshly rate-limited** (~100/day vs 10,000/day with a free key from https://core.ac.uk/services/api).
- **Semantic Scholar free tier is very tight** (~100 reqs / 5 min). Request a key for any serious citation-network work.
- **Google Scholar requires a stealth browser** (camoufox or playwright-stealth v2); legacy `playwright_stealth` API does not work.
- **arXiv enforces HTTPS** — HTTP requests are 301-redirected automatically.
- **Library Genesis legality varies by jurisdiction** — use is the user's responsibility. Pass `--no-libgen` to opt out.
- **Publisher-page extraction (Tier 5) is an in-house, self-contained extractor** — stdlib + `requests`, no third-party dependency and nothing to install (replaces the old broken `zhiping0913/Download_paper` path, issue #136). It fetches the already-accessible official article / DOI landing page and parses `citation_*` metadata + the article body into structured Markdown with a provenance/limitations footer. It performs **no paywall/CAPTCHA bypass and no cookie/credential handling** — official pages only. A login/paywall interstitial, an unsupported DOI prefix, or a page with too little readable text is a clean miss, and the ladder falls through. Skip the tier with `--no-publisher-extract`. The extraction is heuristic (equations/figures/tables may be lost), so treat the artifact as a convenience copy, not a typeset full text. See [reference/publisher-page-extraction.md](reference/publisher-page-extraction.md).
- **Authorized-publisher tier (5b) only uses access you already have** — it follows the official DOI landing page and grabs a same-host publisher PDF, validating `%PDF-` bytes and Content-Type before saving. It never bypasses paywalls/CAPTCHAs and never reads, stores, or replays cookies/credentials; most institutional access is IP-based, so on a licensed network a plain HTTP GET may work. Off-network it harmlessly misses. Pass `--no-institutional` to disable in legal-sensitive environments. Cookies/auth headers are never written to provenance. See [reference/authorized-publisher-access.md](reference/authorized-publisher-access.md).
- **Drafting citation-bearing academic writing without verifying sources first** — under "fast"/"readable draft" pressure the model flattens DOI-verified papers, preprints, and search leads into one confident evidence layer, which reads as submission-ready and invites reviewer rejection. Pass the [evidence-verification gate](reference/evidence-verification-gate.md) before drafting: verify a literature matrix first, keep A/B/C reliability tiers separate in the prose, and reduce scope (not verification) when speed is requested.
- **Writing an empirical paper iteratively can drift from the data** — reviewer rounds make prose more polished and internally consistent without verifying it still matches the experiments on disk. Reviewer agreement is text-consistency evidence, not data-correspondence evidence. Anchor every claim to data files/runner code *before* writing, and re-derive (don't just rewrite) when feedback flags confusion. See [reference/anti-pattern-text-consistency-vs-data-correspondence.md](reference/anti-pattern-text-consistency-vs-data-correspondence.md).
