# LingTai Developer Guide

This skill is the developer router for LingTai. Start here, choose exactly the
reference you need, then read that nested file before touching code. The root
stays short on purpose; the detailed procedures live under `reference/<topic>/`.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Progressive disclosure:** router → nested reference → anatomy skill → code +
  tests. Do not jump straight from memory to edits.
- **Code is truth:** reference files route and summarize; cited source files,
  tests, and `ANATOMY.md` files are authoritative.
- **Anatomy travels with code:** if you move/rename/split/delete code cited by an
  `ANATOMY.md`, update the anatomy in the same commit.
- **Explicit human authorization gates:** do not open/merge PRs, push commits,
  file issues, close/delete resources, or change config unless the human gave an
  imperative authorization for that side effect.
- **Human-facing deliverables prefer HTML:** substantial plans, audits, release
  notes, and PR-readiness reports should be standalone HTML unless waived.
- **Release/install docs rule:** LingTai runtime is normally managed by the
  TUI-created project venv; do not present bare `pip install/upgrade lingtai` as
  the standard user path. Use manual pip/venv commands only for developer,
  diagnostic, or verification contexts.

## Nested reference catalog

`lingtai-dev-guide` owns these nested references. They are parent-owned
drill-down files, not standalone top-level skills.

    objects (services/adapters/caches) actually rebuilt after refresh rather than
    serving stale behaviour, and report evidence with secrets redacted.

## Routing table

| If you need to... | Read |
|---|---|
| Understand the project shape, repos, IPC, and state layout | `reference/architecture/SKILL.md` |

| Make a contribution in TUI, portal, kernel, addons, or skills | `reference/contributing/SKILL.md` |

| Ship a TUI/portal or kernel release | Start at `reference/releasing/SKILL.md` for the overview and authorization boundary, then `reference/release-workflow/SKILL.md` for the full checklist (publishing, HTML release log, release blog) |
| Diagnose a stuck, errored, or misbehaving LingTai network | `reference/debug-troubleshoot/SKILL.md` |
| Audit secrets, permissions, MCP config, channels, or data exposure | `reference/security-audit/SKILL.md` |
| Operate an avatar network over time | `reference/network-governance/SKILL.md` |
| Verify which runtime/binary is actually running after a refresh or rebuild, or why a fix that's on disk still serves stale behaviour (a long-lived service/adapter/cache that didn't rebuild) | `reference/runtime-self-check/SKILL.md` |
| Get a PR review-ready: review gates, HTML explainer, PR hygiene | `reference/pr-review-deliverables/SKILL.md` |

|---|---|---|---|
| `Lingtai-AI/lingtai` | Go + TypeScript | `lingtai-tui`, `lingtai-portal`, bundled utilities | `reference/architecture/SKILL.md`, then `lingtai-tui-anatomy` |

## Common routing examples

- **"I need to change a TUI screen"** → `reference/contributing/SKILL.md` →
  `lingtai-tui-anatomy` → relevant Go files → focused `go test`.
- **"I need to add a capability or inspect runtime behavior"** →
  `lingtai-kernel-anatomy` → relevant kernel anatomy/code → kernel tests.
- **"An agent is quiet or unreachable"** → `reference/debug-troubleshoot/SKILL.md`
  → `lingtai-doctor` if local health surfaces disagree.
- **"I am preparing a release"** → `reference/releasing/SKILL.md` for the overview and authorization boundary, then `reference/release-workflow/SKILL.md` for the full publishing checklist, the required HTML release log, and (for website release blogs) its `reference/release-workflow/assets/release-blog-template.md`.
- **"This broad dev task needs triage"** → run the read-only portfolio sweep in
  `reference/contributing/SKILL.md`, then ask for authorization before mutating
  GitHub state.
- **"Local worktrees are piling up"** → the "Worktree hygiene" section in
  `reference/contributing/SKILL.md`: audit first, remove only merged + clean
  secondary worktrees, record what was removed.
