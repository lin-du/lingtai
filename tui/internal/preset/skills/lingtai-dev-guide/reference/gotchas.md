# Gotchas and Known Pitfalls

Collective wisdom from production incidents. Each entry has caused at least one regression.

## Bubble Tea v2: paste delivery

Bubble Tea v2 splits keys (`tea.KeyPressMsg`) from clipboard pastes (`tea.PasteMsg`). **Any `Update` dispatcher that handles `case tea.KeyPressMsg:` must also forward `tea.PasteMsg` to whichever text widget is focused.** Otherwise paste silently drops.

For embedded sub-models (e.g. `PresetEditorModel` inside `FirstRunModel`), the host's outer `default:` branch must forward paste msgs into the sub-model. If the host's dispatcher enumerates focused widgets per-step but misses the step that hosts an embedded model, paste dies before reaching the sub-model — and adding a fall-through inside the sub-model's own `Update` is useless because the msg never arrives.

**Symptom:** typing into an input works, pasting does nothing.

**Fix:** Trace top-down (`tea.Program` → host's outer switch → sub-model's outer switch → widget) and ensure every layer either handles or forwards `tea.PasteMsg`.

## `textarea` vs `textinput`

`textinput` is single-line and drops characters on multi-byte / clipboard pastes. `textarea` handles paste cleanly. **For any paste-friendly field (API keys, base URLs, anything the user might paste from a browser), use `textarea` even when the content is conceptually one line:**

```go
ta := textarea.New()
ta.CharLimit = 512
ta.SetWidth(50)
ta.SetHeight(1)
ta.ShowLineNumbers = false
ta.Prompt = ""
ta.KeyMap.InsertNewline.SetKeys() // single-line: no newline insertion
ta.SetStyles(themedTextareaStyles())
```

`themedTextareaStyles()` is in the `tui` package — always apply it. A bare `textarea.New()` ships dark default cursor/focus colors that render as a black smear against the warm LingTai theme.

## Dev-mode rebuild gotcha

When running symlinked dev binaries, a stale portal binary against a freshly-migrated project fails with:

```
data version N is newer than this binary supports (M); upgrade lingtai-portal
```

**Root cause:** The TUI and portal share `meta.json`. After ANY migration bump, both binaries must be rebuilt.

**Fix:** After any migration bump:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai/tui && make build
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai/portal && make build
```

The brew-installed pair never hits this because they ship together at the same version.

## Auto-upgrader clobbers editable install

The TUI's auto-upgrader (`config.CheckUpgrade`) compares `lingtai.__version__` to PyPI's latest. If your local source's version is lower, it replaces the editable install with the PyPI wheel.

**Symptom in the launch banner:**
```
Upgrading lingtai 0.8.0 → 0.8.2...
 - lingtai==0.8.0 (from file:///.../lingtai-kernel)   ← editable, gone
 + lingtai==0.8.2                                      ← PyPI wheel
```

**Prevention:** Keep `lingtai-kernel/pyproject.toml` version >= PyPI's latest.

**Recovery:**
```bash
~/.local/bin/uv pip install -e ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai-kernel \
    -p ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv
```

Use `uv`, not `pip` — the venv is uv-managed and has no `pip` symlink.

## Migration cross-package contract

TUI and portal share `meta.json` but have separate migration registries. **When adding a TUI migration, you MUST also bump `CurrentVersion` in `portal/internal/migrate/migrate.go`.**

- Migrations touching shared state → implement in both packages with identical logic.
- TUI-only migrations → add a no-op stub in the portal registry.
- Otherwise the portal refuses to open any project the TUI has already touched.

## Three-locale rule

Adding an i18n key means updating all three of `en.json`, `zh.json`, `wen.json` in **both** `tui/i18n/` and (where applicable) `portal/i18n/`. Missing translations show as the raw key on screen — they don't fall back.

If a key is genuinely English-only (procedural notes, error stacks), document why. Otherwise translate.

## Binary naming

The TUI binary is `lingtai-tui`, **never** `lingtai`. `lingtai` is the Python agent CLI (installed by the kernel into the TUI's runtime venv at `~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/lingtai`). Build the TUI to `tui/bin/lingtai-tui`; never to `tui/bin/lingtai`.

## Preset directory structure

Presets are split into two directories:

- `presets/templates/` — TUI-owned. Rewritten on every Bootstrap from embedded data. Never hand-edit.
- `presets/saved/` — User-owned. Bootstrap never touches it.

The directory IS the answer to "is this a template?" — there's no in-band marker. Each loaded `Preset` carries a `Source` field (`SourceTemplate` / `SourceSaved`). Prefer `IsTemplate(p)` over the legacy `IsBuiltin(p.Name)`.

When writing `manifest.preset.*` paths from Go code, always use `preset.RefFor(p)` to pick the right subdirectory based on `Source`.

## Authorization gate

`manifest.preset.allowed` is the explicit list of preset paths the agent may swap to at runtime. The kernel refuses any swap not in `allowed`. `default` and `active` MUST both appear in `allowed`; `init_schema.validate_init` enforces this.

## Module naming

The Go module names are `github.com/anthropics/lingtai-tui` and `github.com/anthropics/lingtai-portal`. This is historical naming — they are NOT moving to a `Lingtai-AI/` import path even though the GitHub org renamed.

## Notifications — single-slot wire invariant

At most ONE `system(action="notification")` pair lives in the wire history at any time. When the kernel detects a fingerprint change, it strips the prior pair and reinjects a fresh one. Agents observe the **current** notification state, not a history of arrivals.

## `uv` vs `pip`

The TUI's runtime venv is uv-managed. There is no `pip` symlink — only `pip3`. Always use `uv pip` for package operations in this venv.
