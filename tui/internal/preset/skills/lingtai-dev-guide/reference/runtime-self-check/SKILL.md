# Runtime Self-Check

Nested lingtai-dev-guide reference. Read this after the top-level router sends
you here whenever you need to verify *what code is actually running* and report
it without leaking secrets.

This consolidates the most frequently re-implemented diagnostic in the network:
the post-refresh "which runtime am I executing?" probe. Use it after a
`refresh`, a checkout/branch switch, an editable reinstall, a preset swap, or any
MCP/addon config change — and any time a fix "should be live" but behaviour
disagrees.

## Core principle

This is a **read-only diagnostic**. Probe, confirm, and report. The only write
actions explicitly allowed here are developer rebuilds you were asked to do
(`make build`, editable reinstall). Never paste secrets into a report: redact
tokens, keys, chat IDs, and private absolute paths, and prefer repo-relative or
parameterized forms (`<your-lingtai-checkout>`, `~/.lingtai-tui/...`).

## When to use

- Right after a `refresh` — verify the runtime picked up the intended code.
- After switching branches/worktrees or reinstalling the kernel editable.
- A code fix is merged/built but old behaviour persists ("did it actually load?").
- A fix is imported but a long-lived service/adapter/cache still serves stale
  behaviour after `refresh` — source-on-disk ≠ rebuilt-at-runtime (see §6).
- A preset swap, MCP boot failure, or addon change needs source-of-truth checks.
- You must report runtime state to a maintainer and want a safe evidence pack.

## 1. Agent runtime / kernel source probe

Confirm which `lingtai` package the agent venv is executing, whether it is an
editable checkout, and the git HEAD of that checkout. Use the TUI runtime venv
Python (not whatever `python` happens to be on PATH):

```bash
VENV_PY="$HOME/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/python"

# Which lingtai is imported, and is it an editable checkout?
"$VENV_PY" - <<'PY'
import importlib.util, json, os, pathlib
spec = importlib.util.find_spec("lingtai")
origin = spec.origin if spec else None
pkg_dir = pathlib.Path(origin).resolve().parent if origin else None
editable = bool(pkg_dir and "site-packages" not in str(pkg_dir))
print(json.dumps({
    "lingtai_file": origin,
    "package_dir": str(pkg_dir) if pkg_dir else None,
    "editable_install": editable,
}, indent=2))
PY
```

Interpretation:

- A path under `site-packages/` → the published wheel is in front (not dev mode).
- A path under your kernel checkout (`.../lingtai-kernel/src/lingtai/__init__.py`)
  → editable/dev mode is live. This is what you usually want during development.

Then capture the checkout's git state (so a stale HEAD can't masquerade as fresh):

```bash
KERNEL_SRC="$("$VENV_PY" -c 'import lingtai,os;print(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(lingtai.__file__)))')"
git -C "$KERNEL_SRC" rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null
git -C "$KERNEL_SRC" status --short --branch 2>/dev/null | head
```

Editable installs are detected via PEP 610 `direct_url.json` and are *not*
auto-upgraded by the TUI (`tui/internal/config/venv.go:isEditableLingtaiInstall`),
so once dev mode is established it stays. If the import path resolves into
`site-packages` unexpectedly, the auto-upgrader or a `brew reinstall` likely
clobbered it; re-establish dev mode per the dev-guide setup/gotchas references.

## 2. Active binary and dev-mode symlink check

The TUI binary is `lingtai-tui` (never `lingtai-agent`, which is the Python CLI).
Confirm which binary the shell actually resolves and whether dev-mode symlinks
are in place:

```bash
which lingtai-tui
readlink -f "$(which lingtai-tui)"   # expect <your-lingtai-checkout>/tui/bin/lingtai-tui in dev mode
lingtai-tui --version                # -N-gSHORTSHA suffix = dev build; clean vX.Y.Z = brew install in front
```

A clean `vX.Y.Z` version means the brew-installed binary wins; a `-N-gSHORTSHA`
suffix (from `git describe --tags`) means dev mode is live. Do the same for
`lingtai-portal` when the portal is in scope.

## 3. Rebuild the active TUI from a clean release worktree

When you need the running binary to reflect `origin/main` (or a release head),
rebuild from a clean worktree rather than a dirty feature branch. After ANY
rebuild of one binary, rebuild **both** — a stale portal against a freshly
migrated project fails with `data version N is newer than this binary supports`.

```bash
REPO=<your-lingtai-checkout>
git -C "$REPO" fetch origin main --tags --prune

# Build both so TUI and portal stay at the same meta.json version.
cd "$REPO/tui" && make build
cd "$REPO/portal" && make build

# Verify the freshly built binary is what the shell now runs.
readlink -f "$(which lingtai-tui)"
lingtai-tui --version
```

If `/opt/homebrew/bin/lingtai-{tui,portal}` are dev-mode symlinks into the
checkout, each `make build` is picked up immediately — no `brew reinstall`. If
they are real binaries, re-link them (see the setup reference) before expecting
rebuilds to take effect.

## 4. MCP / addon source and tool-surface check

Confirm where MCP/addon modules resolve from and what tool surface is exposed,
without printing any configured secret values:

```bash
VENV_PY="$HOME/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/python"

# Where do addon/MCP modules import from? (sources only, never env values)
"$VENV_PY" - <<'PY'
import importlib.util, json
mods = ["lingtai_imap", "lingtai_telegram", "lingtai_feishu", "lingtai_wechat"]
out = {}
for m in mods:
    spec = importlib.util.find_spec(m)
    out[m] = spec.origin if spec else None
print(json.dumps(out, indent=2))
PY
```

For MCP config, audit references — not values. An MCP entry should reference
`${ENV_VAR}` rather than a hardcoded key; report "uses env reference" vs
"hardcoded (length N)" and never echo the secret. For the full secret/permission
audit methodology and the safe-reporting format, use the
`reference/security-audit/SKILL.md` reference; for MCP boot failures and
preset/path mismatches, see `reference/debug-troubleshoot/SKILL.md`.

## 5. Post-refresh diagnostics checklist

After a `refresh`, walk this list before trusting new behaviour:

- [ ] §1 import probe: `lingtai.__file__` resolves where you expect (editable vs wheel).
- [ ] §1 git HEAD of the imported checkout matches the intended commit; tree state noted.
- [ ] §2 active binary resolves to the expected path; version string matches dev/brew expectation.
- [ ] §3 if a fix should be live, the relevant binary/kernel was actually rebuilt/reinstalled.
- [ ] §4 MCP/addon modules import from the expected source; tool surface present.
- [ ] §6 if a fix "should be live" but behaviour disagrees, the runtime object was actually rebuilt — verified via metadata/fingerprint, not just the import probe.
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, chat IDs, or private absolute paths captured for the report.

## 6. Live object/adapter lifecycle — source-on-disk ≠ rebuilt-at-runtime

The §1–§2 probes confirm the right *files* are imported. They do **not** prove
the long-lived runtime *objects* built from those files were rebuilt after a
`refresh`. A service or adapter constructed once at agent init can survive
refreshes if the inputs that gate its rebuild did not change — so new source can
be on disk and imported, yet the live agent still serves a stale object.

This bit the Codex prompt-cache work (PRs #406/#411). The affinity/cache source
was present and imported, but after a live `refresh` the token ledger still
showed the old stable id with no `prompt_cache_key` and no rotation. Root cause:
the agent only rebuilt its `LLMService` when a coarse rebuild-gate bucket
(provider/model/base_url/provider-defaults) changed; that bucket was stable
across refresh for this provider, so the old service and its cached adapter
outlived the refresh. The fix forced a service/adapter rebuild on the relevant
live refresh while preserving chat-history replay.

The reusable lesson: **when a fix "should be live" but behaviour disagrees,
grepping or importing the source is not evidence — verify the runtime object.**

- Identify what gates the rebuild of the object in question (a service, adapter,
  client, or cache). Confirm that gate actually changes when the fix is supposed
  to take effect — a rebuild that depends on an input stable across refresh will
  silently never fire.
- Verify object *identity/lifecycle*, not just presence: was the adapter
  re-constructed, or is the same instance still alive from agent init?
- Check the observable metadata the fix is supposed to produce. For cache work
  that means the token ledger: is `codex_prompt_cache_key` (or the equivalent
  field) **non-empty**, and does the stable id rotate when it should?
- Where you can compute a fingerprint, compare before/after concretely — e.g. an
  old `sha256(anchor)[:8]`-style id versus an epoch-stamped one — rather than
  trusting "the code looks right."

If the metadata or fingerprint still reflects the old behaviour after refresh,
the object was not rebuilt regardless of what the import probe says; that is the
bug, not a red herring.

## 7. Safe evidence reporting

When reporting runtime state to a maintainer, produce a compact, source-labeled
evidence pack. Recommended shape:

```text
runtime self-check @ <iso-timestamp>
- lingtai source: <package_dir>  (editable=<true|false>)
- kernel HEAD:    <short-sha> [<dirty|clean>]
- active binary:  <resolved path>  version=<vX.Y.Z[-N-gSHA]>
- MCP/addons:     <module>=<source-path>, ... (env-referenced: yes/no)
- anomalies:      <none | short list>
```

Redaction rules, always:

- Replace any token/key/password with `<REDACTED>`; never print env *values*.
- Generalize private absolute paths to `<your-lingtai-checkout>` / `~/.lingtai-tui/...`.
- Telegram chat IDs, emails, and recipient lists are private — omit or redact.
- Report "match found" / "uses env reference", not the matched secret itself.
