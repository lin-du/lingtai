# Contributing to LingTai

This guide covers how to make changes to each component of the LingTai project.

## General principles

1. **Filesystem-only IPC.** The TUI, portal, and kernel communicate exclusively through files. If you need cross-process communication, write a file and let the other side poll.
2. **Anatomy updates are part of the code change.** If your change moves, renames, splits, merges, or deletes a file/function/class cited by an `ANATOMY.md`, update the anatomy in the **same commit**. See the `lingtai-kernel-anatomy` and `lingtai-tui-anatomy` skills for the full convention.
3. **Three-locale rule.** Adding an i18n key means updating all three of `en.json`, `zh.json`, `wen.json` in both `tui/i18n/` and (where applicable) `portal/i18n/`. Missing translations render as the raw key on screen — they don't fall back.
4. **Binary naming.** The TUI binary is `lingtai-tui`, never `lingtai`. `lingtai` is the Python agent CLI inside the runtime venv.
5. **Every PR ships a self-contained HTML explainer for the human.** The deliverable is a single `.html` file under `reports/` at the root of the worktree/repo/workdir, with inline CSS, no remote assets, no build step — open it via `file://`. Name it `pr<NUMBER>-<slug>-explainer.html` once the PR exists (use `<topic>-<date>.html` pre-push, then rename). Write it **before** asking for review or merge, hand the human its absolute path in the short message, and update it in the same PR when blockers or fixes materially change the story. Required sections: TL;DR, baseline, what-was-done (with diff snippets), validation, risks/decisions, next steps, source index. Plain text/Markdown is reserved for the short pointer message and conversational replies. The only exception is a strictly one-line docs/chore PR where the human has explicitly said "no report needed" — absent that waiver, write the HTML even for a small fix. If a change is too small for a useful explainer, that is a signal to bundle it with related work or get the waiver.

## Orchestrator + daemons (how the work happens)

This is the operating discipline for *any* non-trivial LingTai contribution — TUI, portal, kernel, addons, or skills. Read this before you start writing code.

### 1. Clarify and restate the contract

Before dispatching work, restate the task in your own words: what changes, what does not, what "done" looks like, and what is explicitly out of scope. If the request is ambiguous, ask before dispatching. A daemon that runs against a fuzzy brief will deliver a fuzzy diff — and you will pay for it in review time.

### 2. Issue → worktree/branch → PR → merge

Non-trivial work flows through this loop. No exceptions for "small" fixes that turn out to be non-small:

1. **Issue.** Open or pick a GitHub issue that names the problem. If one does not exist, write one — it is the durable record of the contract.
2. **Worktree + branch.** Create an isolated `git worktree` off `origin/main` on a topic branch (`fix/...`, `feat/...`, `docs/...`, `chore/...`). Never edit the main checkout, and never share a worktree across two parallel daemons.
3. **PR.** Push the branch and open a PR against `Lingtai-AI/<repo>`. The PR body cites the issue, summarizes the change, and lists validation steps.
4. **Merge.** After review, merge via the GitHub UI (or `gh pr merge`). Delete the branch and clean up the worktree.

### 3. Decompose into daemon-sized tasks

Orchestrators *plan, dispatch, and review*; they do not hand-code. The right tools for code reading, modification, testing, refactoring, PR preparation, batch scanning, and mechanical validation are the daemon backends:

- **Claude Code daemons** — best for exploratory code reading, multi-file edits, skill/doc work, and PR composition.
- **Codex daemons** — best for tightly-scoped diffs, deterministic refactors, and mechanical validation passes.

Each dispatched daemon must receive:

- **A scoped brief.** What to change, what to leave alone, what "done" looks like, where the source-of-truth files live (absolute paths).
- **Its own worktree and branch.** Daemons do not share a working tree. Parallelism is safe only when worktrees are disjoint.
- **Tests or validation steps.** Whatever check confirms the change works — `go test ./...`, `python -m pytest`, frontmatter parse, `git diff --check`, a grep for the new headings. If no test is applicable, say so explicitly.
- **A do-not-touch list.** Files, directories, or branches the daemon must not modify (e.g., unrelated untracked files in the main checkout, sibling worktrees, the main branch).

Use as much **safe parallelism** as the decomposition allows. Independent daemons run concurrently; dependent steps run sequentially. The orchestrator's leverage comes from running many disjoint daemons in parallel, not from doing more of the work itself.

### 4. Orchestrator reviews diffs and tests; does not hand-code

When a daemon reports back, the orchestrator's job is to:

1. Read the diff (not the daemon's summary — diffs are the ground truth).
2. Run or inspect the validation output.
3. Check imports, cross-file consistency, and adherence to the brief.
4. Either merge/forward, or send the daemon back with a tightened brief.

The orchestrator hand-codes only in narrow cases: emergency hotfixes when daemon dispatch overhead is unjustified, throwaway scratch work, or steering the daemon out of a stuck state. Default to dispatch.

### 5. Routine portfolio sweep before broad planning

Before planning any broad LingTai dev work, run — or dispatch — an org-wide **portfolio sweep**:

- Run a read-only `gh` org sweep across `Lingtai-AI/*` to enumerate open issues and PRs.
- Summarize: stale items, unreviewed PRs, items relevant to the planned work, and items that conflict with what you are about to do.
- Let the current PR/issue surface guide which pieces to pick up, defer, or coordinate around.
- Keep the sweep **read-only**. It informs planning; it does not file new issues or comment on PRs as a side effect.

Skipping the sweep is how you end up duplicating in-flight work, stomping on someone else's branch, or shipping a fix that conflicts with a pending refactor.

### 6. Self-operate GitHub via `GH_TOKEN` when the human provides one

For any of the `gh` invocations above — issue triage, PR creation, the portfolio sweep — if the human pastes a GitHub token into the session and you have bash, use it directly: `GH_TOKEN=$TOKEN gh ...`. Don't print commands for the human to copy-paste and don't require `gh auth login`. Read-only probe first (`gh repo view`, `gh issue list`), then ask explicit per-action consent before any mutation (issue creation, PR open/merge, comments). Never echo, log, or persist the token; let it live only in the env of the single command. The full protocol lives in `procedures.md` under "Self-Operating GitHub via GH_TOKEN".

## Changing the TUI (`tui/`)

### Where to look

- **Screens / UI models:** `tui/internal/tui/` — one file per screen (Bubble Tea convention)
- **Presets:** `tui/internal/preset/` — `preset.go` (~1900 lines) handles load/save/list
- **Migrations:** `tui/internal/migrate/` — append a new `m<NNN>_<name>.go` file
- **Filesystem access:** `tui/internal/fs/` — read-only window into agent working directories
- **Subprocess launch:** `tui/internal/process/` — how agents are spawned
- **i18n:** `tui/i18n/` — en/zh/wen JSON tables

### Build and test

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai/tui
make build                    # builds to tui/bin/lingtai-tui
make cross-compile            # all platforms
go test ./...                 # run tests
```

### Adding a migration

1. Create `tui/internal/migrate/m<NNN>_<name>.go` exporting `func migrate<Name>(lingtaiDir string) error`.
2. Register in `migrate.go`: append to the `migrations` slice, bump `CurrentVersion`.
3. **Also bump `CurrentVersion` in `portal/internal/migrate/migrate.go`** — the TUI and portal share the `meta.json` version space.
4. If the migration touches shared on-disk state (init.json schema, preset paths), implement it in both packages with identical logic.
5. If it's TUI-only, add a no-op stub `Fn: func(_ string) error { return nil }` in the portal registry to preserve the version slot.

### Adding a new screen

1. Create a new Bubble Tea model in `tui/internal/tui/`.
2. Wire it into the main app model's `Update` function.
3. Add i18n keys to all three locale files.
4. Handle `tea.PasteMsg` forwarding if the screen has text inputs (see gotchas).

## Changing the portal (`portal/`)

### Where to look

- **API handlers:** `portal/internal/api/` — `server.go`, `handlers.go`, `replay.go`
- **Filesystem access:** `portal/internal/fs/` — same shape as TUI's, portal-tailored
- **Web frontend:** `portal/web/src/` — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Migrations:** `portal/internal/migrate/` — shares version space with TUI
- **i18n:** `portal/i18n/` — independent of TUI's i18n, same three-locale rule

### Build and test

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai/portal
make build                    # builds web frontend + Go binary
# Output: portal/bin/lingtai-portal
```

The `make build` pipeline: `npm install` → `npm run build` (in `web/`) → `go build` (embeds `web/dist/` via `embed.go`).

### Changing the web frontend

1. Edit files in `portal/web/src/`.
2. `cd portal/web && npm run build` to rebuild the frontend.
3. `cd portal && make build` to embed the new frontend into the Go binary.
4. The frontend is embedded at compile time via `//go:embed all:web/dist` in `portal/embed.go`.

### Migrations

Same contract as TUI — see "Adding a migration" above. Portal-only migrations get a no-op stub in the TUI registry.

## Changing the kernel (`lingtai-kernel/`)

### Where to look

- **Agent runtime:** `src/lingtai_kernel/` — turn loop, lifecycle, tool dispatch, mailbox, soul/molt
- **Wrapper (CLI + services):** `src/lingtai/` — MCP, FileIO, Vision, Search, CLI
- **Intrinsics:** `src/lingtai_kernel/intrinsics/` — email, soul, system, psyche, codex, etc.
- **Skills:** `src/lingtai/intrinsic_skills/` — bundled skill manuals

The kernel-root anatomy at `src/lingtai_kernel/ANATOMY.md` is the entry point for navigating the source. See the `lingtai-kernel-anatomy` skill for the convention.

### Build and test

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai-kernel
pip install -e .              # editable install
python -m pytest              # run tests
```

With the TUI's runtime venv:
```bash
~/.local/bin/uv pip install -e ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai-kernel \
    -p ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv
```

Changes to the kernel source are reflected immediately in the running agent — no rebuild needed (editable install).

### Auto-upgrader gotcha

The TUI's auto-upgrader (`tui/main.go:283`, `config.CheckUpgrade`) compares `lingtai.__version__` to PyPI's latest. If your local source's `pyproject.toml` version is **lower** than PyPI's, the upgrader replaces the editable install with the PyPI wheel — silently undoing dev mode.

**Prevention:** Ensure `lingtai-kernel/pyproject.toml` `version` is `>=` PyPI's latest. After a release bump, pull the kernel repo so your local source matches.

**Recovery:**
```bash
~/.local/bin/uv pip install -e ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai-kernel \
    -p ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv
```

## Changing MCP addons

Each addon (imap, telegram, feishu, wechat) is a separate repo with its own MCP server. See the `mcp-manual` skill for the registration workflow.

```bash
# Install in editable mode
~/.local/bin/uv pip install -e ~/Documents/GitHub/lingtai-imap \
    -p ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv

# Register the MCP server
# See mcp-manual skill for the workflow
```

## Changing skills

Skills live in two places:

| Location | Who owns it | Editable? |
|---|---|---|
| `<agent>/.library/intrinsic/` | CLI-managed. Wiped and rewritten on every refresh. | No — edits will be erased. |
| `<agent>/.library/custom/` | You. CLI never touches this. | Yes. |
| `../.library_shared/` | Network-shared. Add with `cp -r`, edit with admin permission. | Admin only. |
| `~/.lingtai-tui/utilities/` | TUI-shipped utilities. | Depends on the skill. |

To author a new skill, see the `library-manual` skill for the full workflow (frontmatter schema, template, validator, publishing).

## Anatomy maintenance

Every `ANATOMY.md` must be updated in the same commit as the code change it describes. The rules:

- **Every named symbol in Components has a `file:line` citation.**
- **Citations are line ranges, not paragraphs.**
- **Every citation has been verified** — open the cited line and confirm.
- **Cross-references use kernel-root-relative paths.**
- **No leaf stubs, no paraphrase.**

For the full convention, see the `lingtai-kernel-anatomy` skill (Python) or `lingtai-tui-anatomy` skill (Go).

### Cheap mechanical check (Go)

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import pathlib, re
root = pathlib.Path("tui")
for anatomy in root.rglob("ANATOMY.md"):
    text = anatomy.read_text()
    for rel, line in re.findall(r"`?([A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\.(?:go|ts|tsx)):(\d+)", text):
        path = root / rel if not rel.startswith("tui/") else pathlib.Path(rel)
        if not path.exists():
            print(f"{anatomy}: missing citation target {rel}:{line}")
            continue
        n = len(path.read_text().splitlines())
        if int(line) > n:
            print(f"{anatomy}: out-of-range citation {rel}:{line} > {n}")
PY
```

### Cheap mechanical check (Python)

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import pathlib, re
root = pathlib.Path("src/lingtai_kernel")
for anatomy in root.rglob("ANATOMY.md"):
    text = anatomy.read_text()
    for rel, line in re.findall(r"`?([A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\.py):(\d+)", text):
        path = root / rel if not rel.startswith("src/") else pathlib.Path(rel)
        if not path.exists():
            print(f"{anatomy}: missing citation target {rel}:{line}")
            continue
        n = len(path.read_text().splitlines())
        if int(line) > n:
            print(f"{anatomy}: out-of-range citation {rel}:{line} > {n}")
PY
```
